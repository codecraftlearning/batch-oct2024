## Branching and Contribution Rules

- **Main Branch Protection**:

### Steps to Work on the Project

1. **Create a New Branch**:  
   Always create a new branch for your work. For example:
   ```
   git checkout -b your-feature-branch-name
   ```
   Replace `your-feature-branch-name` with a descriptive name for your feature or fix.

2. **Make Your Changes**:  
   After creating a branch, you can edit and add files as needed.

3. **Stage and Commit Changes**:  
   After making changes, stage and commit your work:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of the changes you made"
   ```

4. **Push the Branch to the Remote Repository**:  
   Push your branch to the remote repository:
   ```
   git push origin your-feature-branch-name
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**:  
   Once you’ve pushed your branch, go to the repository on GitHub and create a Pull Request (PR) to merge your changes into the `main` branch. The admin or repository maintainer will review your PR before it gets merged.
